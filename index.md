# About Me

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Devon Ducharme and I am currently a graduate student at Savannah College of Art and Design studying Interactive Design and Game Development. I am a tinkerer at heart with a passion for programming, computer graphics and problem-solving. When I am not working on various projects, I am watching documentaries on modern and ancient history, going on long walks and spending time with my friends.
